I learned how to create a repository on GitHub and access it locally on my computer. 
I also know how to create a branch, merge it with the main, and push it to Git Hub.
However, I had a hard time going from one branch to another branch.
I always confuse the main branch with the branch I created. I still have a lot to learn on GitHub,
so I plan to take a GitHub course on Linkedin to practice with it.
