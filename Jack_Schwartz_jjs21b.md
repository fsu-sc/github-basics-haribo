## What I learned 
- Git is a version control system that allows developers to track changes made to their code over time. This is useful because it allows for collaboration on a codebase by multiple developers. Additionally, it has the has the ability to save previous versions of code if an error occurs. This makes troubleshooting easier, especially on large projects. 

- Github is a web-based platform that streamlines many of the processes that Git uses. Additionally it allows for the creation of remote repositiories where changes can be made and easily merged into the main codebase.

# Using Git and Github

- To use Git, developers first need to initialize a local repository on their computer by running the "git init" command. They can then add files to the repository using the "git add" command, and commit changes to the repository using the "git commit" command.

- Github is used to create new remote repositories. Code can be moved from a local repository to the remote repository on Github using the "git push" command. Remote repositories can be cloned and turned into local repositiories where they can be worked on without internet access. The changes made in the local repository can be moved back into the main repository by submitting and approving a pull request.

- Github branches are a tool used to further isolate code and they allow coders to work on new features or bug fixes in isolation. This provides a way to review and merge changes before finalizing a project.

## What I'm still learning
- I believe that I understand the workflow and basics of Git and Github fairly well. However, there are more advanced features such as project management and continuous integration that I still want to get a better understanding of. 

- I also had some struggles initially when using Git's features on my computer's terminal. The web features of Github were much easier to use but I believe that I'll get better at using Git in the terminal with more practice.
