# About GitHub 

I have created a new GitHub repository in my profile and you can acces it [here](https://github.com/RSchama/DataSci_Health).  

## What I have learned so far

> Git is a **Version Control System** (VCS), where you can track the changes made your code (or project), collaborate and share. 
> It is a command line tool.  
> GitHub provides the web interface for Git.  

The GitHub workflow includes a few important concepts described below. 
A good way of working with it is by copying the repository you want to work with to your own system. You can than make changes on your local machine and when your are done you can `commit` the changes you made and than `push` everything to the main server.  

- `Repositories` --> This is the project "folder", where it all happens. It should contain all the files for a specific project and the revision history. It can contain folders, files, images, spreadsheets, videos, data sets and more. It is good practice to include a `README.md` file with info about the project.  
- `Clonig` --> This is how we copy the repository from the server to our own machine to create a local copy. After making the changes we want we can use `Git` to sync the two. This makes it possible for us to use the editing tool that we want. It is important to be aware that your branch is a copy/snapshot of the `main` branch at the time, if people make changes to `main` while you are working it is important to `pull` in those changes so you are always working on the most up to date version of the project.   
- `Committing` and `pushing` --> This is how we add tha changes we made on our local machine to the remote repository on GitHub. We make `commits` and after a few or whenever we are satisfied with our work we `push` to add all the changes to the repository. The changes we make to each file usually render a `commit`, and it is good practice to explain a little what we did in the comment section.  
-  `Branching` --> To isolate the work you do want to merge into your final project just yet. It is good use to develop new features, fix bigs, experiment new ideas without changing your main branch. You can work on different versions of your repository at a time. At the end you can merge the `branch` into the default `main` Branch.  
-  `Fork` --> Another way to copy a repository, usually used when copying from another user's account. You take a project you cannot write and modify under your account. This way you can contribute to someone else's project.  
-  `Pull request` --> There two reasons to make a `pull request`, when working in a team you can make a `pull request` to tell others the changes you made and ask for feedback. We can add specific people as reviewers and discuss the changes made and make more changes if necessary. At the end we `merge` with the `main` branch. We also use a `pull request` when we want to make changes to someone else's project that we have `forked` before. They can or not accept the pull and merge the changes to their repository.  
-  `Issues` --> This is a way to track enhancements, tasks, bugs, or just tell people what you intend to work on. Can also be used to tell another project about a bug or new feature that would be good for them to create.  
-  `Merge` --> after making changes we can `merge` them to the `main` branch of the project.   

### The README.md file

This is an extremely important file of your project. Nevertheless, many people do not worry about it too much. But if I understand correctly, if you want people to use your code for anything, it is important to explain briefly what your project is, what is it good for and how people can use it. It is also helpful to say how people can contribute to your project and what do you expect.     

## What I have still to learn

There a few issues that I am not entirely certain on. Especially related to collaboration in a team. Since I have not done anything on a team yet I am still a little confused to what is the best way of doing this. For example, for this specific case where we need to create a file and afterwards start a pull request to Dr. Zavala-Romero, I am creating a new branch for this `commit`. Should I have commited to the main branch first though? OR is it good practice, or even needed, to always breate a branch?
Most of the issues I have are related to what's good practice when you collaborate with other people. Also, how to wirte a good, which a compelling, README.md for a project for example.  

Another aspect I have not yet figured out is how best to update my changes using either `Git`, or the `GitHub Desktop` or even `VScode` to the web. I have always changed the files on my computer than updated them using my webrowser and GitHubhe web on t, which is why I am very familiar with creating branches yet.  

But practice makes perfect, so it will be good to use GitHub for our assignments this semester!
